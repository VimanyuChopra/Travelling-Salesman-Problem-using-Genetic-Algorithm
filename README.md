# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This project takes a look at Genetic Algorithms. The aim is to use self-evolving Genetic algorithm in order to optimize Travelling salesman problem (TSP). This is done using Python and its associated libraries. The results are then recorded and represented graphically. Performance of genetic algorithmic approach is compared to brute force method. The results are analyzed for performance and rate of improvement. F
